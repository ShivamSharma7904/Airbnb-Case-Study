# Airbnb-Case-Study
Airbnb is an online platform that allows users to rent unused accommodations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Airbnb faced a major decline in revenue due to reduced travel. As travel has resumed, this project analyzes Airbnb data to understand post-COVID trends and support business recovery.

The analysis is performed using Python and data visualization libraries to explore patterns in listings and pricing, providing insights that can help improve decision-making in the travel and hospitality domain.
